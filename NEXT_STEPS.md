# NEXT STEPS - DSG Trading Bot Development 🚀

This document outlines the immediate next steps for continuing development and optimization of the DSG (Defence, Gold, Silver) ETF trading bot.

## 🔍 Immediate Review Tasks

### 1. ETF Focus Validation (🔴 HIGH PRIORITY)

**Task**: Validate current ETF selection and ensure proper configuration

**Actions Required**:
