# InstrumentName: The stock's name is fetched and used as the primary key to update the DynamoDB table.
# EligibilityStatus: The script fetches eligibility status from Chartink data. If the stock meets certain conditions, it is marked as 'Eligible'; otherwise, it is 'Ineligible'.
# BaseValue: This script does not update the BaseValue unless the stock becomes ineligible, at which point the BaseValue is reset to null.
# FirstDayProcessed: If a stock becomes eligible for the first time, the FirstDayProcessed flag is set to True. If the stock becomes ineligible, this flag is reset to False.
# The script ensures that ineligible stocks have their BaseValue reset and FirstDayProcessed updated accordingly. However, it doesnâ€™t set a new BaseValue for eligible stocks.
