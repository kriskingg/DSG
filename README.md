## üìà Trading Strategy
### Core Concept
Beest implements a systematic approach to buying stocks as they decline in price, based on predefined percentage thresholds.
### Purchase Logic
```
Initial Purchase: Buy BaseQuantity shares at InitialPrice
Price Drop -2%: Buy AdditionalQuantity more shares
Price Drop -4%: Buy AdditionalQuantity more shares
Price Drop -6%: Buy AdditionalQuantity more shares
... and so on
```
### Gap Down Handling
When a stock opens with a gap down:
```
If gap down >= 2%:
  Calculate: GapDownMultiplier = floor(GapDownPercentage / 2)
  Buy: GapDownMultiplier √ó AdditionalQuantity shares
```
### Key Parameters
- **BaseQuantity**: Initial number of shares to purchase
- **AdditionalQuantity**: Additional shares to buy at each threshold
- **InitialPrice**: First purchase price (reference point)
- **PriceDropThreshold**: Percentage drop that triggers a purchase (typically 2%)
- **LastPurchasePrice**: Most recent purchase price to prevent duplicate buys
## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
### config.json Example
```json
{
  "base_quantity": 10,
  "additional_quantity": 5,
  "price_drop_threshold": 2.0,
  "monitoring_interval": 60,
  "eligible_stocks": [
    "RELIANCE",
    "TCS",
    "INFY"
  ],
  "trading_hours": {
    "start": "09:15",
    "end": "15:30"
  }
}
```
### Environment Variables
- `BROKER_API_KEY`: Your broker API key
- `BROKER_SECRET`: Your broker secret
- `DYNAMODB_TABLE`: DynamoDB table name
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for DynamoDB
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
## üìä Examples
### Example 1: Normal Price Drop Scenario
```
Stock: RELIANCE
InitialPrice: ‚Çπ2500
BaseQuantity: 10
AdditionalQuantity: 5
Sequence:
1. Day 1: Buy 10 shares @ ‚Çπ2500 (Initial)
2. Price drops to ‚Çπ2450 (-2%): Buy 5 shares
3. Price drops to ‚Çπ2400 (-4%): Buy 5 shares
4. Price drops to ‚Çπ2350 (-6%): Buy 5 shares
Total: 25 shares, Average Price: ‚Çπ2425
```
### Example 2: Gap Down Scenario
```
Stock: TCS
Previous Close: ‚Çπ3600
InitialPrice: ‚Çπ3600
AdditionalQuantity: 5
Scenario:
Next Day Open: ‚Çπ3480 (-3.33%)
GapDownMultiplier: floor(3.33 / 2) = 1
Action: Buy 5 shares (1x AdditionalQuantity) @ ‚Çπ3480
```
### Example 3: Large Gap Down
```
Stock: INFY
Previous Close: ‚Çπ1500
InitialPrice: ‚Çπ1500
AdditionalQuantity: 5
Scenario:
Next Day Open: ‚Çπ1450 (-3.33%)
GapDownMultiplier: floor(3.33 / 2) = 1
Action: Buy 5 shares (1x AdditionalQuantity) @ ‚Çπ1450
```
Original Example 3 had wrong math:
Previous Close: ‚Çπ150
Next Day Open: ‚Çπ145 (3.33% gap down)
Action: Buy 15 shares (3x AdditionalQuantity) at ‚Çπ145
```
