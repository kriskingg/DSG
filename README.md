## üéØ Overview
Beest is a Python-based automated trading system designed to capitalize on market dips by implementing a systematic approach to buying additional quantities of stocks as their prices decline. The system uses DynamoDB for data persistence and integrates with stock market APIs for real-time price monitoring.
### Key Benefits
- **Dollar Cost Averaging**: Automatically buys more shares at lower prices
- **Risk Management**: Structured approach to prevent emotional trading
- **Gap Down Handling**: Smart logic for market gap-down scenarios
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous price monitoring and execution

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Automated Price Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of eligible stocks
- **Percentage-Based Buying**: Purchases additional quantities based on price drop percentages
- **Gap Down Detection**: Handles market gap-down scenarios intelligently
- **DynamoDB Integration**: Persistent storage for stock data and trading history
- **Eligibility Management**: Dynamic eligibility checking for stocks
- **Redundancy Prevention**: Avoids duplicate purchases at same price levels
## üì¶ Modules
### üöÄ main.py
The main entry point of the application that orchestrates the entire trading workflow:
- Initializes the trading environment
- Coordinates between different modules
- Manages the main execution loop
### üîê login.py
Handles authentication with the trading platform:
- Manages session tokens
- Implements TOTP-based two-factor authentication
- Handles login failures and retries
- Secures API credentials
### üìâ price_drop.py
Core module implementing the price drop buying strategy:
- Monitors real-time price changes
- Calculates percentage drops from initial purchase price
- Executes buy orders based on predefined thresholds
- Implements gap-down detection logic
- Updates DynamoDB with transaction records
- Prevents duplicate purchases at same price levels
### ‚úÖ beest_eligibility_and_price_check.py
Manages stock eligibility and price verification:
- Validates if stocks meet eligibility criteria
- Fetches current market prices
- Cross-references with eligible stock list
- Updates stock status in database
## üìä Trading Strategy
### Price Drop Thresholds
The bot purchases additional quantities based on these percentage drops:
| Drop % | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 1% | Buy 1 additional quantity |
| 2% | Buy 1 additional quantity |
| 3% | Buy 2 additional quantities |
| 4% | Buy 2 additional quantities |
| 5% | Buy 3 additional quantities |
| 6%+ | Buy 4 additional quantities |
### Gap Down Logic
Special handling for stocks that open significantly lower:
1. Detects gap-down at market open
2. Calculates drop percentage from previous close
3. Executes appropriate buy quantity based on gap percentage
4. Updates tracking to prevent redundant purchases
### Redundancy Prevention
- Tracks all executed purchases in DynamoDB
- Maintains price level history
- Prevents multiple purchases at same drop threshold
- Ensures systematic execution without duplication
## ü§ñ Automated Workflows
Beest includes several GitHub Actions workflows for automation and testing:
### üìà Trade_Script_with_DB.yml
**Purpose**: Main production trading automation workflow
**Trigger**: Scheduled (Monday-Friday at 3:45 AM UTC / 9:15 AM IST)
**Key Functions**:
- Runs the complete trading bot during market hours
- Authenticates with TOTP-based two-factor authentication
- Monitors eligible stocks and executes price drop strategy
- Updates DynamoDB with transaction data
- Handles errors and provides execution logs
**Environment**: Uses AWS credentials and trading API secrets from GitHub Secrets
**Note**: Currently commented out for safety - uncomment when ready for production
### üß™ additional_quantity_logic.yml
**Purpose**: Testing workflow for additional quantity buying logic
**Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch
**Key Functions**:
- Tests the price drop threshold calculations
- Validates quantity determination logic
- Ensures gap-down scenarios are handled correctly
- Verifies redundancy prevention mechanisms
**Use Case**: Development and testing of core buying logic before production deployment
**Note**: Currently commented out - enable when testing logic changes
### üîë login_with_generated_totp.yml
**Purpose**: Authentication and TOTP generation testing
**Trigger**: Scheduled (weekdays at 3:45 AM UTC) and manual dispatch
**Key Functions**:
- Tests authentication flow with trading platform
- Validates TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) generation
- Verifies session token management

- Review price drop alerts and purchase confirmations
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
### Stock Eligibility
Edit `rupeezy_instruments_list.txt` to modify the list of eligible stocks.
### Price Drop Thresholds
Modify the threshold logic in `price_drop.py`:
```python
def calculate_additional_quantity(drop_percentage):
    if drop_percentage >= 6:
        return 4
    elif drop_percentage >= 5:
        return 3
    elif drop_percentage >= 3:
        return 2
    else:
        return 1
```
### Schedule
Adjust workflow schedules in workflow YAML files:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '45 3 * * 1-5'  # Runs Mon-Fri at 9:15 AM IST
```
## üìù Examples
### Scenario 1: Normal Price Drop
```
Initial Purchase: Stock XYZ at ‚Çπ100
Current Price: ‚Çπ97 (3% drop)
Action: Buy 2 additional quantities
Result: Average cost reduced, position increased
```
### Scenario 2: Gap Down
```
Previous Close: ‚Çπ100
Market Open: ‚Çπ94 (6% gap down)
Action: Buy 4 quantities immediately
Result: Capitalized on gap-down opportunity
```
### Scenario 3: Redundancy Prevention
```
First drop to ‚Çπ97: Bought 2 quantities
Price fluctuates between ‚Çπ96-‚Çπ98
Action: No additional purchase until next threshold (‚Çπ95)
Result: Avoided redundant purchases
```
## üîÆ Future Enhancements
